In the rapidly evolving digital business landscape, the surge in online activities has been paralleled by a sharp increase in fraudulent incidents. Traditional rule-based fraud detection systems, while effective to an extent, fall short in addressing the dynamic and sophisticated nature of contemporary online fraud. This research paper delves into the realm of machine learning-driven fraud detection, focusing on the deployment of Amazon SageMaker as a comprehensive solution. The primary objective of this study is to develop a fraud detection framework that possesses adaptability, self-improvement, and scalability, all crucial aspects for businesses operating in the online sphere. The paper showcases the integration of SageMaker into the fraud detection pipeline, highlighting its role in fostering an iterative approach to model enhancement and adaptation. By harnessing SageMaker's capabilities, businesses can proactively combat fraud, swiftly respond to evolving tactics, and scale their defenses according to the demands of their online operations. As businesses continue to migrate online, the proposed approach presents a promising avenue for fortifying their security measures against the ever-evolving landscape of online fraud.
